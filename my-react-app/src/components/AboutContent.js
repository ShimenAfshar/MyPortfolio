            <p>After gaining valuable experience in the beauty industry, I embarked on an exciting journey in the tech world, driven by a desire for fresh challenges. By enrolling in Code Your Future's 10-month part-time full-stack bootcamp, I not only honed my skills but also expanded my knowledge. Now, I am actively seeking a company that nurtures a positive work culture and provides a supportive environment for growth. With unwavering motivation, I am dedicated to continuous personal and professional development.</p>
